# JointDesign

## Installation
1. Clone the repository and run the setup script:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yehlincho/JointDesign.git
    cd JointDesign
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```
## Features
1. **Protein Generation**: Generate protein structures and sequences using our TrORS, TrMRF, or Joint (TrORS+TrMRF) models. These models are experimentally validated to produce stable designed proteins.

2. **Zero-shot Folding Stability Prediction**: Leverage our hybrid scoring function that combines ESM2, ESMFold, and ProteinMPNN to accurately predict protein folding stability. This integrated approach outperforms individual models.

3. **Potential Analysis**: Analyze sitewise and pairwise potentials of generated proteins.
